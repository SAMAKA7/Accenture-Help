    <h2>Subject: Urgent: Request for Assistance and Referral - Application Issues</h2>
    <p>
      Greetings to you,
      <br><br>
      I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a persistent issue I have been facing in the application process that has been unresolved for the past five months.
      <br><br>
      On July 26, 2023, I successfully completed both the technical and aptitude assessments for the ASE role. Unfortunately, despite passing these evaluations, I have not received any further updates or communication regarding my application. In an attempt to address this, I raised a ticket four weeks ago, which prompted me to apply for an alternative role as the ASE position was reportedly closed.
      <br><br>
      Now, as I try to apply for the PADA role, I am encountering difficulties in receiving the OTP for verification, and I am not getting any OTP for password updates. Despite passing all assessments, this issue persists, and I have exhausted all efforts, including raising multiple tickets. Additionally, I have not received any rejection communication.
      <br><br>
      Given that the cooling-off period is typically three months, and it has now been five months, this situation is concerning. While others seem to be able to apply, I am unable to do so, and it appears that this issue may persist into the future unless resolved manually or until my data is cleared from the backend.
      <br><br>
      In light of these challenges, I kindly seek your support with a referral for the PADA role. I possess a strong background in relevant projects and a skill set aligned with the role's requirements. I have attached my resume, along with all the necessary documents, for your reference. I am ready and willing to undertake any additional tests or assessments to validate my skillsets.
      <br><br>
      My Candidate ID for the ASE role is 6923075, and my registered email is sameerafzalkhan777@gmail.com. Your assistance in resolving this matter and considering my referral request would be immensely appreciated.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for your time and consideration.
      <br><br>
      Best regards,
      <br>
      Khan Sameer
